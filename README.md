# Rusty Cascading Style Sheets (RCSS)

**Rusty Cascading Style Sheets (RCSS)** is a styling language that brings Rust-inspired syntax to CSS. It combines the robustness of Rust with SASS-like features such as nesting and variables for cleaner, more maintainable styles.

---

## Features
- **Rust-Inspired Syntax:** Write styles with a familiar, simple, and easy-to-remember syntax.
- **Nesting:** Organize CSS rules hierarchically.
- **Variables:** Easily manage design variables and color schemes.

---

## Roadmap

### âœ… Phase 1: Core Features (Current)
- Implement Rust-like syntax parsing.
- Support variables and nesting.
- Build a compiler that transpiles RCSS to standard CSS.

### ðŸš§ Phase 2: Enhancements (Upcoming)
- Add functions for reusable styles.
- Implement importing
- Improve error handling and debugging tools.

### ðŸ”® Phase 3: Future Plans
- Develop a VS Code extension with syntax highlighting and code completion.
- WASM support.
